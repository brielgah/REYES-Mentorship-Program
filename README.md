# A brief introduction to Functional Data Analysis
With the increase of data generation by human activities, both online and offline, and the arise of data analysis we need more tools and methodology to process this complex data. This project aims to introduce Functional Data Analysis as a way to process data that can be viewed as smooth functions, also list their types, show examples and differences about these types. Finally, we explain how we can build the smooth functions that represent the data and an example of this process.
