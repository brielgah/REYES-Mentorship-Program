# A brief introduction to Functional Data Analysis
With the increase of data generation by human activities, both online and offline, and the arise of data analysis we need more tools and methodology to process this complex data. This project aims to introduce Functional Data Analysis as a way to process data that can be viewed as smooth functions, also list their types, show examples and differences about these types. Finally, we explain how we can build the smooth functions that represent the data and an example of this process.

The code was done using the _fda_ package, the files named 'Example#.R' were taken from the _fda_, the code the other files was done by me. The pdf file contains the report delivered at the end of the program and the pptx is the presentation used to talk about what I learned during the program.
